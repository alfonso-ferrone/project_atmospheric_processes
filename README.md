# Snippets of Pyton code for the project of the Atmospheric processes course.

The code requires the following libraries to have been installed:
- datetime
- scipy
- numpy
- netCDF4
- cartopy
- matplotlib

The jupyter notebook that performs the installation of the libraries needed for the "radar exercise" already installs them.
So, if you followed the exercise, to run this notebook on noto you will only need to select the "Radar_ex" kernel.
